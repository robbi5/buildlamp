### What we wanted

We wanted a noticeable feedback when some jobs from our Continous Integration (Jenkins) failed. When anything goes horribly wrong, the whole office is alerted by a light turning red.

### What we got

...is exactly this (and more). We built and tried different lamps with a web interface and wlan connection and felt, this is pretty easy and affordable. 

The lamps are easy to build and have a HTTP API so you can remotly change the color and brightness or let them fade and blink.

### What's to find here

In the subfolders you can find different types of buildlamps and a manual to make them Jenkins ready. Additionally, the HTTP API makes it easy to use the lamps for all kind of purposes, like a "do not disturb" lamp, or a lamp which shows your computers cpu temperature or... — you can most likely think of better uses.
