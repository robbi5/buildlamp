## buildlamp â€” visual notifications everywhere

* beatiful

### What we wanted

We wanted a noticable feedback when some jobs from our Continous Integration (Jenkins) failed. When anything goes horribly wrong, the whole office is alerted by a light turning red.

### What we got

Is exactly this and more. We built and tried different lamps with a web interface and wlan connection and felt, this is pretty easy and affordable. 

The lamps are easy to build and have a web server so you can remotly change the color and brightness or let them fade and blink.

### What's to find here

In the subfolders you can find different types of buildlamps and a manual to make them Jenkins ready. Additionally, the web interface makes it easy to use the lamps for all kind of purposes, like a "do not disturb" lamp, or a lamp which shows your computers cpu temperature or.. you can most likely think of better uses.

Try it out, build your buildlamp and share what you did via the issue page or tweet us [@buildlamporg](https://twitter.com/buildlamporg)
